üßë‚Äçüåæ KisanSarthi: AI-Driven Precision Agriculture AssistantKisanSarthi is a Multimodal AI-powered mobile application designed to democratize precision agriculture for smallholder farmers, particularly in the Indian context. It provides personalized, real-time advisory on crop selection, fertilizer application, and plant disease diagnosis to maximize yield and profitability.üéØ The Precision Agriculture Access Gap (Problem)Smallholder farmers often struggle with high operational costs and suboptimal yields because they lack access to personalized, data-driven advice. They typically rely on generalized methods, leading to:Inefficient Resource Management: Mismanagement of soil nutrients ($\text{N, P, K, pH}$) results in wasted fertilizer and soil degradation.Suboptimal Crop Selection: Planting crops that aren't the best match for their specific soil and local climate.Delayed Threat Response: Slow disease identification and lack of real-time market data increase the risk of crop loss.KisanSarthi solves this by integrating Sensors, AI (Text/Data), and Computer Vision (Images) to provide comprehensive, actionable guidance directly on a mobile phone.‚ú® Key Features & Multimodal IntegrationKisanSarthi is a highly practical demonstration of Multimodal AI, combining diverse data streams to create contextually aware recommendations.FeatureModality IntegratedFunctionality Demonstrated (See Video)1. AI Crop SuggestionSensors/Data (N, P, K, pH)Recommends the most suitable crop (e.g., Apple with a 65% Match) based on current soil data, ensuring the optimal selection for the farm.2. Precision FertilizerSensors/Data (N, P, K levels)Based on low nutrient readings, it recommends the exact fertilizer type and amount (e.g., Apply Urea 46-0-0 at 100 kg per hectare).3. Soil MonitoringSensors/Data (Moisture, Temp)Displays real-time and historical soil nutrient data, moisture (e.g., 87%), $\text{pH}$ (e.g., 6.7), and temperature readings.4. Plant Disease ScanImages / Computer Vision(Future Scope / Architecture Readiness) Allows a farmer to upload a photo of a leaf to get an instant diagnosis and remedy.5. Market Value CheckExternal Data (Text)Fetches real-time market prices for crops, enabling farmers to make informed selling decisions.üèóÔ∏è Technical ArchitectureThe application follows a standard mobile-backend architecture for scalability and clear separation of concerns.Frontend: Built using Flutter (Dart) for a beautiful, cross-platform mobile user interface (Android/iOS).Backend: A REST API built with Python (likely Flask/Django/FastAPI) to host the core AI/ML models.AI/ML Models:Crop/Fertilizer: Classification/Regression models trained on agro-climatic data (N, P, K, $\text{pH}$, etc.).Disease Diagnosis: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition.üõ†Ô∏è End-to-End Setup InstructionsFollow these steps to set up and run the KisanSarthi application locally.1. PrerequisitesYou must have the following installed on your system:Flutter SDK (for the mobile frontend)Python 3.8+ (for the backend server)Git (for cloning the repository)2. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/somanathdiksangi/KISANSARTHI.git
cd KISANSARTHI
3. Backend SetupThe backend hosts the AI models and handles data processing.Navigate to the backend directory:Bashcd backend
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:Bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment VariablesCreate a file named .env inside the backend directory with the following content. You must replace the placeholders with your actual keys.Bash# ===============================================
# Environment Variables for KisanSarthi Backend
# ===============================================

# 1. Google Gemini API Key
# Used for potential future AI Assistant features.
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

# 2. Weather/Agri-Specific API Key
# Used for fetching real-time weather and climate data.
WEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY_HERE"

# 3. Server Configuration (Adjust if necessary)
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8080 
Run the Backend Server:Bashpython main.py  # Or the appropriate entry file for your Python framework
The server should now be running, typically at http://127.0.0.1:8080.4. Frontend (Mobile App) SetupThe frontend connects to the running backend.Navigate to the frontend directory:Bashcd ../frontend/kisansarthi
Fetch Flutter packages:Bashflutter pub get
Update API Endpoint:You may need to modify the base API URL in your application's configuration files (e.g., a constants file or a service file) to point to your running backend (e.g., http://10.0.2.2:8080 for Android emulator or your local IP for a physical device).Run the App:Bashflutter run
